These files use lazy substitution, which is not usefull in this research. They are put aside.

The firsts results showed that translated and JITing translated versions have similar results on cases without function declaration (see repertory resultTests). Whenever there is a function declared, JITing version becomes way slower.

A possible explanation would be the tests the JIT interpreter runs to know if it has already encounter the loop.
