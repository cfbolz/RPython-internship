RPython-internship
==================

Working on RPython during an undergraduate internship

This is the work I'm doing during my last undergraduate year's internship. I'm trying to use RPython to produce efficient AST-based interpreters. These are mostly backup files so the whole thing is a bit messy. 
If you're interested in the work, you can read what's in the midtimeReport reportory which is cleaner that the rest.
